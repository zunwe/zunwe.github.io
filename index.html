        <h2>Growing Up</h2>
       <p>I was born in Burma and grew up in the States. I remembered the struggle to fit in. It took around a year for me to truly get used to living in another coutry.</p>
       <p>Growing up in the States made me really think about my identity, ethnicity, and nationality. These topics that used to confuse me as other people decide what I am. A part of growing up is you get to know more about youself, something I'm still doing.</p>

       <h2>Currently</h2>
       <p>As I step into the adulthood, there are still so many things I'm unsure about. After highschool is college and after college should be a job. But, what should I do if I don't even know what I want to be in the future?</p>
       <p>Being an adult sure is terrifying when you're unsure about your future. There have probably been so many young adult before me who felt this and now doing just fine. I hope one day I too will know what I want to do in life.</p>
